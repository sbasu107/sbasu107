# Hi, I’m Shobhin 👋

I’m a Computer Science and Data Science student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison interested in building **software systems that interface with the physical world**, from real-time telemetry to metal additive manufacturing.

## 🔧 What I work on
- **Real-time & embedded systems** (C++ / Python, Linux)
- **Hardware-integrated software** (microcontrollers, CAN, serial, LTE)
- **Data acquisition & visualization** for high-rate sensor systems
- **Manufacturing & controls software** for experimental and production environments

## 🧪 Experience highlights
- **Undergraduate Researcher @ Morgridge Institute for Research**  
  Developed Python-based control and visualization software for an **electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF) metal additive manufacturing system**, interfacing with embedded hardware and live system state.

- **Software Lead @ Badger Solar Racing**  
  Architected a real-time telemetry platform streaming CAN data from microcontrollers over radio and LTE. Building multithreaded services and led a 6-person team delivering driver dashboards and monitoring tools. Currently serving as an administrator for the team’s GitHub organization, managing repositories and access.
